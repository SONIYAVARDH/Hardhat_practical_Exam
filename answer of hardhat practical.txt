ans.1) Hardhat and Truffle are both development framework for Ethereum,but they have different features and use cases. Here are the key differences:
       1. - Development Environment and Tooling:
            Hardhat - offers a flexible and extensible environment with a focus on developer experience.it includes built-in tools like a local Ethereum network for deploying, testing,debugging and task management
            Truffle - provides a suite of tools for ehtereum development,including compliation,linking,deployment and binary management.Truffle integrates with Ganache,it's own personal blockchain for ehtereum development.
       2. - Configuration :
            Hardhat -Uses JavaScripts or TypeScript for configuration,making it highly customizable. the configuration is done in a single hardhat config.js file.
            Truffle - uses a more declarative approach with a truffle-config.js file for project configuration.It is simpler but less flexible compared to hardhat.
       3. - Plugins and Extensibility:
            Hardhat - has a rich plugin ecosystem,allowing developers to extend functionalties easily. 
            Truffle - Also support plugins but is gernarally less modular than hardhat.
       4. - Testing:
            Hardhat - supports JavaScript anf TypeScript for testing and intgrates well with other testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai.
            Truffle - Primarily uses JavaScripts for testing with built-in support for Mocha and Chai.
       5. - Debugging :
            Hardhat - Known for its advanced debugging capabilities, including a built-in debugger and the hardhat network that can snapshot and revert the state of the blockchain.
            Truffle - provides a debugger, but it is less advanced compared to hardhat's tools.


ans2. ) The steps to compile this contract using hardhat:
        1. Initialize a New Hardhat Project :Open a terminal, create a new directiory with the name of hardhat-project and navigate into it. Run npx hardhat and follow the prompts to create a basic sample project.
        2. Install Hardhat : for installing hardhat run npm install --save-dev hardhat.
        3. Write your smart contract : save the above silidity code in  file named token.js inside the contracts directory of your Hardhat project.
           
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

//Solidity files have to start with this pragma.
//It will be used by the Solidity complier to vaildate its version.

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

// This is the main building block for smart contracts.
contract Token {
    // Some string type variables to identify the token.
    string public name = "My Hardhat Token";
    string public symbol = "MHT";

    // The fixed amount of tokens, stored in an unsigned integer type  variable.
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000;
    //An address type variable  is used to store ethereum accounts.
    address public owner;

    //A mapping is a key/value map. here we store each account's balance.
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    // The Transfer event helps off-chain applications understand 
    // what happens within your contract.
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);

    /**
    *Contract intialization.
     */

constructor(){
    // The totalSupply is assigned to the transaction sender, which is the 
    // account that is deploying the contract.
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    owner = msg.sender;

    }

    /**
    * A function to transfer tokens.
    *
    *The `external` modifier makes a function *only* callable form *outside*
    * the contract.
     */
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    
    //check if the transaction sender has enough tokens.
    // If `require`'s first argument evaluates to `false` then the
    // transaction will revert.
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens");

    // Transfer the amount.
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;

    //Notify off-chain applications of the transfer.
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    } 

    /**
   * Read only function to retrieve the token balance of a given account.
   *
   * The `view` modifier indicates that it doesn't modify the contract's
   *state, which allows us to call it without executing a transaction.
    */
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
    return balances[account];
    
    }     
}  




        4. configure Hardhat : open hardhat.config.js in project root directory. ensure it's configured for the solidity version of contract.

require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
};
        5. Compile the contract : Run npx hardhat compile in terminal. hardhat will compile your contracts and generates aritifacts(like ABI and bytecodes) in the aritifacts directory.
        6. Check Compilation Output : After successful compilation, you should see output indication the creation of new files in the artifacts directory.
